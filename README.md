Extended data for Craig, Kumar and Hedges MS: "The origin of eukaryotes and rise in complexity were synchronous with the rise in oxygen"


Input data and R scripts or control files are provided to build the phylogenies of archaeal- and bacterial-origin genes, and to reconstruct biological complexity through time using TimeTree of Life 5.
